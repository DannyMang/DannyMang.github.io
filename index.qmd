Hi! My name is **Daniel Ung**, and I'm currently an **Undergrad CS student** at **San Jose State University**.

Currently learning more about Reinforcement Learning and Distributed Training. I want to contribute to making cheaper AI and lowering the hardware requirements to democratize access to SOTA capabilities, giving everyone the opportunity to push what is possible.
