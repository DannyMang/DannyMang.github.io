Hi! My name is **Daniel Ung**, and I'm currently an **Undergrad CS student** at **San Jose State University**.

Currently learning more about Reinforcement Learning and Distributed Training. I believe that making distributed training accessible to all will enable the next wave of what is considered possible with AI.
